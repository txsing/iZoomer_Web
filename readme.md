* iZoomer_Web is a web application that provide online photo zooming service.

* This project is under support of China National College Students Innovation Training Programme

* The logic behind is a self-designed adaptive interpolation algorithm based on Cubic Spline Fitting, which computes the value of new pixels according to the cubic spline fitted by the value of 16 surrounding pixels, and then interpolates the new pixel into zoomed low-resolution image to improve its quality.
